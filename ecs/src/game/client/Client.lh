/*
 *  Functions for creating a Client, which contains the client-side systems
 *  and memory needed when the game is running as a client.
 *
 *  It's probably more appropriate for this to be an engine level interface
 *  as well, that simply hooks into the game (as I would like this project
 *  to try and keep the Engine agnostic of the Game running in it for
 *  possible reuse in future projects), but for now I'm going to keep it
 *  under game/ to simplify implementing it, as it avoids needing to design
 *  the Client and Server to be modular in what they run.
